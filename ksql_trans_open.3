.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ksql_trans_exclopen ,
.Fn ksql_trans_open ,
and
.Fn ksql_trans_singleopen
functions open transactions with different lock states.
All functions accept
.Fa sql ,
the database connection; and
.Fa id ,
an identifier used in error reporting and in making sure that
transaction calls are symmetric.
Each of these functions must be followed by
.Xr ksql_trans_commit 3
or
.Xr ksql_trans_rollback 3 .
.Pp
If
.Fn ksql_trans_open
is used
.Pq a Do DEFERRED Dc transaction, in SQLite terms ,
the database is locked only when the first database operation
is invoked.
The lock is read-shared (multiple readers, no writers) for a read
operation and is upgraded to write-single (multiple readers, single
writer) on a write.
.Pp
If
.Fn ksql_trans_singleopen
is used
.Pq Dq IMMEDIATE ,
the database is immediately locked in write-single mode.
.Pp
If
.Fn ksql_trans_exclopen
.Pq Dq EXCLUSIVE ,
the database is opened in a write-exclusive lock, where only the calling
process may write or read from the database.
.Pp
Recursive transactions are disallowed.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This returns
.Dv KSQL_NOTOPEN
if the database connection is not open,
.Dv KSQL_TRANS
if a transaction is already open,
.Dv KSQL_DB
if errors occurred on the database, or
.Dv KSQL_OK
on success.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
