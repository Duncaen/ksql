.Dt KSQL_CLOSE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql_close
.Nd close a ksql database connection
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdint.h
.In ksql.h
.Ft enum ksqlc
.Fo ksql_close
.Fa "struct ksql *sql"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function closes a database connection opened with
.Xr ksql_open 3 .
If the connection was not opened, is already closed, or
.Fa sql
is
.Dv NULL ,
this function is a no-op.
.Pp
This function will begin by calling
.Xr sqlite3_finalize 3
on all active statements (it is an error to have any open connections),
then it will roll back any open transactions (also triggering an error)
if found,
then it will close out the database itself with
.Xr sqlite3_close 3 .
In the event of statements still being open, all statements are
finalised and the database closed prior to calling the error handler.
If
.Dv KSQL_FAIL_ON_EXIT
was specified on
.Fa sql ,
the
.Xr exit 2
will only be invoked after all resources have been closed and freed.
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This returns
.Dv KSQL_STMT
if there were open statements,
.Dv KSQL_TRANS
if there was an open transaction
(if there were both open statements and a transaction, this is
returned),
.Dv KSQL_DB
if there were database-level errors (this overrides whether there were
open transactions and/or a transaction), or
.Dv KSQL_OK
on success.
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
