.Dt KSQL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql
.Nd yet another SQLite wrapper
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ksql.h
.Vt enum ksqlc ;
.Vt struct ksql ;
.Vt struct ksqlcfg ;
.Vt struct ksqlstmt ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ksql
library is a
.Dq lazy man's
wrapper of a minimal subset of the SQLite C API.
It makes interfacing with SQLite easy and fast for you, and safe for
your database.
.Pp
The typical usage scenario is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
allocate a handle with
.Xr ksql_alloc 3 ;
.It
open a database connection on that handle with
.Xr ksql_open 3 ;
.It
create statements with
.Xr ksql_stmt_alloc 3
and use them with
.Xr ksql_bind_double 3 ,
.Xr ksql_stmt_double 3 ,
and
.Xr ksql_stmt_free 3 ;
or
.It
execute statements with
.Xr ksql_exec 3 ;
.It
close and free with
.Xr ksql_free 3 .
.El
.Pp
There's also support for maintaining transactional consistency with
.Xr ksql_trans_open 3
and
.Xr ksql_trans_commit 3 .
Invoke
.Dq apropos ksql 
to see all functions.
.Ss Database safety
By default,
.Nm ksql
will trigger calls to
.Xr exit 2
if any of the database functions fail.
It will also register an
.Xr atexit 3
hook that will clean up any open database connections, transactions, and
open statements and make sure that
.Dv SIGABRT
and
.Dv SIGSEGV
signals are intercepted and trigger a controlled exit.
Thus, if your program fails while performing (say) transactions, or any
sort of open database, you won't corrupt the data.
.Ss Compiling
To compile with
.Nm ksql ,
use the header file
.In ksql.h
and link to
.Fl l Ns Ar ksql
.Fl l Ns Ar sqlite3 .
.Ss Access protocol
Since SQLite uses a busy-wait approach,
.Nm
will sleep for random intervals between attempts returning
.Dv SQLITE_BUSY
or
.Dv SQLITE_LOCKED .
Within the first 10 attempts, the random interval is within 1/4 second.
Within the 10\(en100 attempts, within 1/10 second.
Greater than 100 attempts, 1/100 second.
This scheme benefits longer waiters.
.Pp
Functions using this algorithm are
.Xr ksql_exec 3 ,
.Xr ksql_stmt_step 3
and
.Xr ksql_stmt_cstep 3 ,
and
.Xr ksql_stmt_alloc 3 .
