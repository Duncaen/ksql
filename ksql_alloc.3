.Dt KSQL_ALLOC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ksql_alloc
.Nd allocate a ksql database handle
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb ksql
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In ksql.h
.Ft struct ksql *
.Fo ksql_alloc
.Fa "const struct ksqlconfig *cfg"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function creates a SQLite database handle.
This must be matched by a call to
.Xr ksql_free 3
(unless
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
is specified, in which case it will be freed on exit) and is usually
followed by
.Xr ksql_open 3 .
If
.Fa cfg
is
.Dv NULL ,
useful defaults are used.
.Pp
The defaults on
.Fa cfg
are that the
.Dv KSQL_EXIT_ON_ERR
and
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
flags are set, which means that any errors in using database routines
will trigger an exit; and upon exiting in such a state, the database
will be properly cleaned up.
Moreover, a simple message will be written to
.Dv stderr
with the full error message and error code for both regular and database
errors.
.Pp
The
.Vt struct ksqlconfig
structure consists of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va unsigned int flags
A bit-field which may consists of
.Dv KSQL_EXIT_ON_ERR ,
which causes the system to
.Xr exit 3
if any database errors occur;
.Dv KSQL_FOREIGN_KEYS ,
which causes the database to be subsequently opened with foreign key
support; and
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT ,
which causes the library to register an
.Xr atexit 3
hook to free the database if it hasn't be freed prior to exit.
The
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
flag will also cause the
.Dv SIGABRT
and
.Dv SIGSEGV
signals to be caught and
.Xr siglongjmp 3
into an exit handler, which will then close out open databases.
.It Va ksqlmsg err
Supply a function that will be invoked upon a non-database error, for
example, memory allocation.
.It Va ksqldbmsg dberr
A function that will be invoked upon a database error, for example, if
.Xr sqlite3_step 3
does not return an
.Dv SQLITE_DONE
or
.Dv SQLITE_ROW
code.
.It Va arg
The private argument passed to
.Va err
and
.Va dberr .
.El
.Pp
The
.Vt ksqlmsg
function is invoked as
.Ft void
.Fo ksqlmsg
.Fa "void *arg"
.Fa "enum ksqlc code"
.Fa "const char *file"
.Fa "const char *msg"
.Fc ,
with
.Fa arg
being the private argument,
.Fa argc
being the error code in question,
the database
.Fa file
.Po which may be
.Dv NULL Pc ,
and
.Fa msg
being an ASCII string describing the error (in English).
.Pp
The
.Vt ksqldbmsg
function is
.Ft void
.Fo ksqldbmsg
.Fa "void *arg"
.Fa "int sqlerr"
.Fa "int sqlexterr"
.Fa "const char *file"
.Fa "const char *msg"
.Fc ,
which also has the
.Fa sqlerr
and
.Fa sqlexterr
SQLite error and extended error code, and and the SQLite string error
message
.Fa msg .
The library exports two functions,
.Fn ksqlitemsg
and
.Fn ksqlitedbmsg ,
which are used as the defaults.
