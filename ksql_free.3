.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ksql.h
.Ft enum ksqlc
.Fo ksql_free
.Fa "struct ksql *sql"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function frees a database handle
.Fa sql ,
previously allocated with
.Xr ksql_alloc 3 .
This internally invokes
.Xr ksql_close 3
then frees all internal memory.
If the handle was allocated with
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT ,
the handle is removed from the queue of handles that would be freed on
exit (so it is not double-freed).
.Pp
This function is invoked from the
.Xr atexit 3
handler if
.Dv KSQL_SAFE_EXIT
was specified and the handle was not freed prior to exiting.
In this case, the
.Dv KSQL_EXIT_ON_ERR
flag is suppressed.
